> The components are built using [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) and also relies on some components from [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation).
> Make sure to initialize shadcn in your project before proceeding.

Add components by using the `npx` command in your project root directory:

### Add all components

```bash
npx shadcn-chat-cli@latest add --all
```

### Add individual components

To view a list of all available components run the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn-chat-cli@latest add
```

Or add a specific component by running the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn-chat-cli@latest add <component-name>
```

The components will be added to the `src/components/ui/chat` directory.
